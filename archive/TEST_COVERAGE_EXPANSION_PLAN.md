# Test Coverage Expansion Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to expand test coverage for the API endpoints of the Open-Hivemind application. The current test coverage has significant gaps, with approximately 75% of the ~80 endpoints lacking any tests. This plan prioritizes critical endpoints and details the types of tests required to ensure the stability, reliability, and security of the application.

## 2. Prioritization

The test implementation will be prioritized based on the criticality of the endpoints. The following order is proposed:

1.  **Priority 1: Critical Operations**:
    *   **Admin Endpoints**: These are critical for managing the application and have the highest potential impact if they fail.
    *   **Agent Management**: Core CRUD operations for agents are fundamental to the application's functionality.
    *   **MCP Server Management**: Essential for the integration with external MCP servers.

2.  **Priority 2: Core Functionality**:
    *   **Configuration Management**: Endpoints for managing application configuration are crucial for its operation.
    *   **Hot Reload**: Ensures that configuration changes can be applied without downtime.

3.  **Priority 3: Monitoring and Health Checks**:
    *   **Activity Monitoring**: Important for tracking and analytics.
    *   **Health API Monitoring**: Essential for ensuring the overall health of the API.
    *   **WebUI Consolidated**: System status and validation endpoints.
    *   **Dashboard Activity**: Activity feed for the dashboard.

## 3. Test Plan

This section details the specific tests to be implemented for each of the uncovered endpoint categories.

### 3.1. Admin Endpoints (15 endpoints)

These endpoints manage the core administrative functions of the application.

**Endpoints:**
*   `GET /api/admin/status`
*   `GET /api/admin/personas`
*   `POST /api/admin/personas`
*   `PUT /api/admin/personas/:key`
*   `DELETE /api/admin/personas/:key`
*   `POST /api/admin/slack-bots`
*   `POST /api/admin/discord-bots`
*   `POST /api/admin/reload`
*   `GET /api/admin/llm-providers`
*   `GET /api/admin/messenger-providers`
*   `GET /api/admin/mcp-servers`
*   `POST /api/admin/mcp-servers/connect`
*   `POST /api/admin/mcp-servers/disconnect`
*   `GET /api/admin/mcp-servers/:name/tools`
*   Other admin endpoints...

**Tests to Implement:**

*   **Happy Path:**
    *   Verify that each endpoint returns the expected successful response (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created).
    *   Verify the structure and content of the response data.
    *   For POST/PUT endpoints, verify that the resource is correctly created or updated.
    *   For DELETE endpoints, verify that the resource is correctly deleted.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Test with valid but unusual inputs (e.g., empty strings, special characters).
    *   Test pagination, sorting, and filtering parameters if applicable.
    *   Test creating resources with duplicate names or keys.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Test with invalid input data (e.g., missing required fields, incorrect data types).
    *   Test unauthorized access (e.g., without a valid token).
    *   Test accessing non-existent resources (e.g., GET/PUT/DELETE with an invalid ID).
    *   Test for server errors (e.g., database connection issues, mocked).

### 3.2. Agent Management (8 endpoints)

*   `DELETE /api/agents/:id`
*   ... and other agent management endpoints.

**Tests to Implement:**

*   **Happy Path:**
    *   Verify successful creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of agents.
    *   Verify that the list of agents is returned correctly.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Test with various valid agent configurations.
    *   Test updating an agent with partial data.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Test creating an agent with invalid or missing data.
    *   Test accessing, updating, or deleting a non-existent agent.
    *   Test for unauthorized access.

### 3.3. MCP Server Management (8 endpoints)

Endpoints for managing MCP server integrations.

**Endpoints:**
*   `GET /api/mcp/servers`
*   `POST /api/mcp/servers`
*   `GET /api/mcp/servers/:id`
*   `PUT /api/mcp/servers/:id`
*   `DELETE /api/mcp/servers/:id`
*   ... and other MCP server management endpoints.

**Tests to Implement:**

*   **Happy Path:**
    *   Verify successful connection, disconnection, and management of MCP servers.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Test with valid but unusual server configurations.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Test connecting to an invalid or unreachable MCP server.
    *   Test operations on a non-existent MCP server.
    *   Test for unauthorized access.

### 3.4. Activity Monitoring (7 endpoints)

    *   Test for unauthorized access.

## 4. Test Strategy

*   **Framework**: Continue using the existing `jest` testing framework.
*   **Mocks**: Use mocking for external dependencies (e.g., databases, external APIs) to ensure tests are fast and reliable.
*   **Authentication**: Tests for protected endpoints should include cases for both authenticated and unauthenticated users.
*   **Data**: Use a dedicated test database or mock data to ensure tests are isolated and repeatable.
*   **CI/CD**: Integrate the new tests into the existing CI/CD pipeline to ensure they are run automatically on every commit.

## 5. Execution Status

The test coverage expansion has been successfully implemented according to the plan.

### Completed Phases:
*   **Phase 1 (COMPLETED)**: Implemented comprehensive tests for Admin (40 tests), Agent Management (8 tests), and MCP Server Management (8 tests) endpoints.

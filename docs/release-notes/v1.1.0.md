## v1.1.0 (2025-08-14)

This release focuses on Mattermost parity, a Convict-driven configuration overhaul, and quality-of-life improvements for documentation and CI.

Highlights
- Mattermost parity: REST client, WS events (posted/edited/deleted), optional typing, wakeword/mention gating, file uploads, and a proper `MattermostMessage` wrapper.
- Single source of truth for configuration: Convict schemas now include `level` (basic/advanced) and `group` annotations. A generator builds `docs/config-reference.md` directly from schemas.
- Centralized env reads: Slack, Discord, Replicate, and provider selection now flow through config modules (no scattered `process.env` in codepaths).
- New onboarding docs: `docs/basic-settings.md`, `docs/advanced-settings.md`, and `docs/config-system.md`.
- CI: `docs:check` ensures config docs stay in sync.

Upgrade Guide
- No breaking changes expected for existing `.env` users. Convict still maps env vars via `env` in each schema.
- If you previously depended on internal metadata JSON files under `src/config/meta`, they are removed. Use Convict schemas and `docs/config-reference.md` instead.
- If you ran scripts that generated docs differently, switch to `npm run docs:config`.

Notable Changes
- Mattermost
  - Added `MATTERMOST_WS_ENABLED` (default true) and `MATTERMOST_TYPING_ENABLED` (default false).
  - Added REST support for send/threads/history and join.
  - Implemented Mattermost file upload flow.
- Message / Behavior
  - `FORCE_REPLY` (advanced) for testing.
  - Idle response keys: `IDLE_RESPONSE_ENABLED`, `IDLE_RESPONSE_MIN_DELAY`, `IDLE_RESPONSE_MAX_DELAY`.
  - LLM rate caps: `LLM_MESSAGE_LIMIT_PER_HOUR`, `LLM_MESSAGE_LIMIT_PER_DAY`.
  - Channel routing flags retained and classified as advanced.
- OpenAI
  - Provider uses only config accessors; retry count set via `OPENAI_MAX_RETRIES`.
- Slack (optional)
  - `INCLUDE_SLACK_METADATA`, `SLACK_INCLUDE_HISTORY`, and `SUPPRESS_CANVAS_CONTENT` now in slackConfig.
  - Headers set via Slack config rather than raw env.
- Replicate (image predictions)
  - New `replicateConfig` centralizes token, version, prompt, webhook URL.
- Discord
  - Circuit breaker thresholds/timeouts configurable through `discordConfig`.

CI & Docs
- New GitHub Actions workflows to check config docs and run lint/tests.
- Generated `docs/config-reference.md` covers all keys, with env names and defaults.

## Live Chat Monitor

The Live Chat Monitor allows administrators to observe conversations across all active bots in real-time. This is useful for monitoring bot performance, debugging responses, and ensuring quality interactions.

### Features

-   **Bot List**: View all configured bots and their connection status (Online/Offline) in the sidebar.
-   **Conversation History**: Select a bot to view its recent chat history with users.
-   **Real-time Updates**: Use the Refresh button to fetch the latest messages.
-   **Read-Only Mode**: Currently, the interface is read-only. Sending messages directly from the admin panel is disabled to prevent interference with automated flows.

### How to Use

1.  Navigate to the **Chat** section in the admin sidebar.
2.  Click on a bot from the list on the left.
3.  The main view will load the recent message history for that bot.
4.  Click the **Refresh** icon in the header to update the view with new messages.

## 2025-02-26 - Add SSRF Protection to Outbound Requests

**Vulnerability:** External APIs calls to configurable or dynamic endpoints were made via `axios` without validating the URL, potentially leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
**Learning:** Although primary parameters like `baseUrl` come from server configurations, the absence of verification for out-bound requests exposes the internal network if configuration falls back to external payloads or is manipulated. Defense in depth matters.
**Prevention:** Every outbound request (using `axios` or similar) must validate its target destination by running it through the custom `isSafeUrl` function to check for valid protocols and ensure no routing to private/loopback IPs.

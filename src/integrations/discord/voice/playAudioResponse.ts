 * Plays an audio response in a Discord voice channel.

 * to ensure reliable playback and to handle any issues that arise.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - **Voice Channel Management**: Joins the voice channel and handles connection events.
 * - **Audio Playback**: Plays the specified audio file using Discord.js voice utilities.
 * - **Debugging and Error Handling**: Includes detailed logging for connection status and playback issues.

# Security Incident Report

## Incident Summary
A sensitive `.env.backup` file containing live API keys and tokens was discovered in the repository. This file was located at `dist/config/environments/.env.backup` and posed a significant security risk as it exposed credentials in version control.

## Actions Taken
- The file has been permanently removed from the working directory.
- The file path has been added to `.gitignore` to prevent future accidental commits.
- This documentation has been created to record the incident and provide guidance.

## Proper Credential Management
To prevent future security incidents:

1. **Never commit sensitive files**: Always ensure `.env` files and backups are excluded from version control.
2. **Use environment variables**: Store sensitive data in environment variables, not in files committed to the repository.
3. **Gitignore sensitive files**: Maintain comprehensive `.gitignore` rules for all sensitive file patterns.
4. **Regular audits**: Periodically audit the repository for accidentally committed sensitive data.
5. **Credential rotation**: Immediately rotate any credentials that may have been exposed.

## Prevention Measures
- All `.env*` files are already ignored via `.gitignore` patterns.
- The specific backup file path has been explicitly added to `.gitignore`.
- Developers should use `.env.example` or `.env.sample` files for configuration templates without sensitive data.

## Recommendation
Immediately rotate all API keys and tokens that were present in the exposed file to mitigate any potential unauthorized access.
